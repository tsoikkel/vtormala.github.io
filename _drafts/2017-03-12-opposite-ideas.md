This is my collection of oppposite ideas about central topics of Software Development. I originally made it for myself to clarify my own ideas. 

If I'd have to name the two opposing ideas, they would be:

* **Traditional Ideas** (Manufacturing mindset, Tayloristic thinking, SW Factory...)
* **Alternative Ideas** (Agile, Lean, DevOps, Systems Thinking, Complexity Theory...) 

I know. In real life things are not as black and white as this form of presenation indicates. Although I am huge advocate of the alternative ideas, the idea is not to point right and wrong answers but to highlight differences in thinking. 

------

## Definition of Done

* **"Project (work) ends in production deployment"** Production deployment is done at the end of the project. Big lauch at the end.

* **"Project (work) starts from the first production deployment"** First production deployment is done within days (or even hours) from the kick-off. Gradually building full-time production usage.

## Planning

* **"Do it right the first time"** Big upfront design. Deliver in one big batch (or in several big batches).

* **"Add needed pieces only when needed."** Deliver in small pieces incremantally, in streams.

## Process

* **"One time process with separate functional phases and roles"* Separation of work and working units. Tayloristic desing of work.

* **"Iterate over the process many times fast as a cross-functional team"** Whole team approach. Cross-functional teams.

## Decision making

* **"Analyse and gather all needed information beforehand."** Get needed knowledge before starting the actual development work. 

* **"Software development is a knowledge creation process."** Decide as late as possible.

## Architecture & Design

* **"Know all (most) technical details in the beginning."** Create detailed design and architecture upfront.

* **"Focus on vision and goals."** Let details emerge during the process."Plan on adequate level (sometimes quite a lot, find the boundaries). Iterate and evolve design and architecture. 

## Focus on plans

* **"Focus on following the plan and delivering according to plan"**

* **"Focus on delivering outcomes and value"**

# Definition of Success

* **"Keeping project in time/budget/schedule"** Fixed schedule, budget, scope

* **"Measured added customer value"** Flexibility over scope. Digg into value of each feature. Optimizing value requires being flexible over scope.

## How to go fast

* **"Work harder and keep everyone busy"** Manage efficiency and utilization. Optimize time and resources to get faster.

* **"Focus on flow efficiency, keep the work flowing"** Manage and optimize product development flow to get faster. 

## Efficiency, speed, cost

* **"We need to code faster"** Cost is in the length of an activity. Optimize each separate activity to get faster. 

* **"We need to work smarter"** Cost is in the inefficient flow. Optimize the flow and remove waste to get faster.

## Quality

* **"Inspect quality when done"** Use external measures to inspect quality. Fix possible problems at the end.

* **"Build quality in"** Prevent defects from happening. Add quality within the work. Stop the line when process is broken.

## Learning, improvement

* **"Improve through company wide standardization and best practices."** Separate improvement projects. Work is driven by processes and practices.

* **"Improve  through experimentation within the work."** Learning and improving build in to the work. Follow principles agreed within the team.

# Process Ownership

* **"Company owns the process. Use audits and standards."** Single loop learning: "Are we doing this right"

* **"Autonomy and ownership of the work is within the team."** Team owns and improves its working process. Double loop learning: Why are we doing this?

## Learning, improvement

* **"Analyse project success in the end or in the phase-gates."** Late learning. Lessons-learned studies / post-mortems.

* **"Aim for fast feedback cycle."** Get feedback after every iteration / all the time (hourly, daily, weekly)

## Decision making

* **Centralized decision making outside the team**

* **Those who do the actual work make decisions**

## Value, benefits

* **"Analyse value"** Analyse value based on planning phase studies.

* **"Measure value"** Analyse and measure value early based on actual data from production use.

## Risk management

* **"Manage deliverable and process quality"** Milestone plans and phase-gates, proceed when certain criteria is met. Fail at the end (usually), impact and cost is high.

* **"Reduce risk everyday"** Build high risk and high value items first. Mitigate risks by doing the risky work right away. Fail fast, impact and cost of failure is low.
