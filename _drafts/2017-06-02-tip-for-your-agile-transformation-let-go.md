**One fundamental problem in traditional organisations is the separation of thinking and doing. That is the notion where the managers' role is to think and plan how to do the work. And then, it is the workers' role to execute according to plans handed to them. Organisations where this type of thinking prevails often end up doing their transformation efforts the same way. And that is one major reason why  transformations fail.**

First the basics: 

> All major modern/agile/lean/whatever organisation transformations are greatly about increasing the power and incluence of the people who are doing the grass-rool level work.

But still many transformation efforts end-up like this:

* "We are discussion this on our next management meeting"
* "You are welcome to comment on the plans the management is making"
* "Our new CEO will come up with a plan"

To me, this equals missing the point. 

> One of the first things to do, is to shift and redistribute the work of doing the thinking. It's about bringing together all doing and thinking that happens in the organisation. And this should be visible in the structures and practices as well.

I know, it's a big step. And yes, there are risks.  Something will definitely go wrong. People will not automatically know how to do things that were proviously taken care of by someone else. 

It takes time. It is not easy. [You need patience.](http://villetormala.com/storytime-patience)

But they will learn. And once they know more, the whole organisation knows more. And then you have better more and more healthy organisation. And definitily it will be more agile/lean/whatever.

> Organizational change is not about adopting a new trendy method. It's about chaning the structures that keep the old ways of working in place.

And no, inviting more people to work with the existing management process is not about redistributing power. People need to own and create their own their own work.  Then they have enough contextual knowledge and influence to improve it.

Although remowing waste and optimizing workflows are central in lean, they are not the real essense of it. Instead, one of the most important success factors in lean is the *"ability to harness the intellect of each ordinary employees"* to do and improve the work all the time. If you want to have an lean organisation, your fancy kanban board is just a collection of post-it notes without changes in the prevailing structures.

What about the managers who used to do all the thinking and planning? They have a now role. To teach, mentor, provide inspiration. Talk about the future. Have meaningfull discussions.

But as a first step, let go.
