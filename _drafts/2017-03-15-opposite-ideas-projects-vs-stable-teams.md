This part 2 of my collection of oppposite ideas about central topics of Software Development. Like in the previous post, I originally made this for myself to clarify my own ideas. 

This time the opposing ways of thinking are

* **Project Thinkin**
* **Stable Teams Thinking** 

Again, In real life things are not as black and white. 

Yes, you guessed right. I favor stable teams thinking. This table actually summarises the toolbox I use when starting to work with a struckling "team" (usually pseudo team).

------


##Staffing

* **Projects based organization and project resourcing.** Move people based on project needs.

* **Organization is build around stable and cross-functional teams.** Work is designed to fit stable teams. Manage the contents of the work that teams pull to their backlog.

## Focus of improvement

* **Become better at resourcing people into projects.** 

* **Focus on building as good teams as possible and creating an environment for teams to flourish.** Become better at building communities.

## Optimize

* **Start as many projects as you can** The more the projects, the more the progress. Start new because there is work on hold.

* **Limit the number of projects.** The better the flow, the better the progress. Finish before starting new.

## Management focus

* **Available resources, needed resources.** Optimize projects (optimize locally).

* **Value and flow (iterate on value, remove waste…)** Optimize products/services (optimize globally, end-to-end)

## Unit of production

* **A single person.** Specialised roles. Organizations are built around projects. Individuals as a unit of productions, individuals get the work done (and are rewared for it)

* **Cross-functional stable team.** Organizations are built around stable teams. Teams as a unit of production, teams get the work done. When work is done, its impossible to say who did it and who gets the reward.

## **Efficiency**

* **”Measure how well resources are used to achieve ends”** 

* **"What we can do differently?“ “How to improve?”** Manage flow and waste. Iterate on value.

## Assignment

* **”Executing a plan brings success” ”Complete this project as agreed”**
Work according to plan made by someone else. Local optimization.

* **”Plan how to deliver a solution to these customers”** 
"Here is the problem and goal. Find a best solution." (Teams work on ”strategic level”). Global optimization.

## Method for improvement

* **”Doing the work is the work”** Improvement projects, improved processes, train people lecture style. Single loop learning: are we executing this right?

* **”Doing the work and improving the work is the work.”** Improve team capability. Build-in improvement, front-line experiments and learning. Douple-loop learning: Are we doing the right things?

## Nature of the work

* **Work gets done when each of the needed special roles does their part according to plan.**

* **Daily work involves solving unique problems together.** The workers themselves have the best knowledge of the work. Leaning and development happens when people work on problems together.

## Goals

* **Individual goals**

* **Team goals, shared goals**
