There is a a term for a phenonon how medicines have concuerred almost all aspects of our lifes: 

> MedicalizationÂ (or medicalisation) is the process by which human conditions and problems come to be defined and treated as medical conditions, and thus become the subject of medical study, diagnosis, prevention, or treatment. (Wikipedia)

It is not simply good or bad, but a definitely something complex and ubiquitous.

I see a similar thing to happen in organizations. I call it ticketization and here is my quick definition:

> Ticketization (or issueization for all JIRA users out there) is the process by which all the thinng and problems come to be defined as a set of simple tickets, issues or  tasks. All problems, goals and endevours become the subject or creating, assigning and tracking tickets. 

Tickets/issues/tasks/stories what ever you choose to call them, they are everywhere. Good luck on trying to get your IT support to do something without a ticket on their system.

And when things go too far, here is what happens:

The usual antipatterns:
* Everyone is completing their own tickets only
* Someone else is creating the tickets (doing the thinking)
* Over using ticketing systems as management system, JIRA management

And of course there is more:
* No adaptability over tickets
* No working on the whole, "focus on issue level"
* Tickets as a velocity metrics
* Focusing on ticket process/flows instead of improving the actual product development flow
*  Discussing over tickets only
* Managing the service over tickets (SLAs over created value)
