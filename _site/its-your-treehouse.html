            <h1>It's Your Treehouse</h1>

            <p><em>Creating a team space is more than suitable seating arrangement. As a leader your job is not to tweak the office space but to arrange prober conditions for the team to build their own treehouse.</em></p>

<p>Team needs a place where to work together. So, with that basic requirement, what are you about to build?</p>

<p>Do you arrange “an office space” for the team? Plan and fix seating arrangements? Perhaps add a coffee maker and a plant to put finishing touches to it. This is all fine, but in my opinion not enough.</p>

<p>I propose another kind of mindset: Find a place where team can build their own “team space”. To distinguish it from an “office space”, I woulr call it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Team Lounge</li>
  <li>Living room</li>
  <li>Hideout</li>
  <li>Lair</li>
  <li>Refuge</li>
  <li>Garage</li>
</ul>

<p>Even a treehouse.</p>

<p><img src="/img/treehouse.jpg" alt="Treehouse" /></p>

<p>I am sure you can come up with a better name. Naming is important because words convey meaning. All the examples above embody different thinking and ideas than “office space”.</p>

<h1 id="its-your-treehouse">It’s Your Treehouse</h1>

<p>You want to have a dedicated place where your team feels like home. Something they build and belongs to them. It’s their sofa, their coffee maker, their rituals, their rules. And most probably, their mess, too.</p>

<p>In your treehouse, you feel safe to speak out, present your ideas, wear an ugly T-shirt etc. Something that you probably wouldn’t do in a large open space with 50 other (strange) people. Openness and transparency is a good target. But too much of it can prevent collaboration, experiments and healthy amount of risk taking.</p>

<p>Teams and individuals need some level of privacy. Maybe add phone booths in the treehouse where people can go when they need personal privacy and silence.</p>

<p>But the idea is not to hide yourself from the rest of the world. You want to have the opposite. It’s better to have good quality meetups rather than being exposed to clutter that doesn’t concern you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your treehouse is not only a place where you do your work.  A place where you <em>invite others</em>. And make it <em>easy for others to make a visit.</em> Kind of like your home.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="nomeetings">#nomeetings</h1>

<p>For a team, going into a meeting somewhere else can imply broken power structures (decision making), wasted time, slow cadence (waiting for meetings) and poor productivity.</p>

<p>Finding a time slot that suits all and booking a meeting room is slow and unproductive – waste. Inviting people to have mini retrospective should be matter of minutes, not days (or even weeks).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having a separate meeting scheduled long in the future to plan, review, meet, make decisions, get more info, discuss etc. can be considered an anti-pattern.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the treehouse, there is a plenty of space in the walls (whiteboards) to draw. TV-screen or two. A sofa. Webcam. Etc. Your treehouse is the 24/7 ~meeting~ conversation room.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You want to replace as many meetings you can with good quality conversations. Team has a good chance of success when do the work and all the time talk about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>

<p>You already know the rationale behind all this. When you really want to have results, individuals and interactions matter.</p>

<p>Fluent information flows are essential. In team’s shared audible and visible space, everyone usually knows what is happening.</p>

<p>All forms of communication are not equal. Rich forms of communication make all the difference. Try having a Skype meeting with and without video. Actually seeing the people you talk with changes the experience and how you interpret the message. We are human after all.</p>

<p>A brilliant working environment for the team is a priority. The goal is to have good quality information flow and rich form of communications.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the enabling conditions are the, you can expect the quality of the conversations to get better. This is a basic requirement for the team to learn and start developing their own ways of working.</p>
