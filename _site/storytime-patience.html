            <h1>Storytime: Patience</h1>

            <p><strong>My colleague worked with a newly formed team couple of years ago. The story he shared reminded me of having realistic expectations and patience when we talked about unlearning old ways of working.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Team made a plan how to deliver a set of features within one month to customer. Plan was made together and team was content with it.</p>

  <p>After some time, my colleague who was coaching the team, noticed that team will not  be able to complete all the features they had planned and committed to. He decided to ask the team how they should communicate this to their customer.</p>

  <p>The answer was clear. “It’s not our problem. You are the boss, it’s your job to do the explaining”, said one of the member of the team. Obviously, this wasn’t the answer he was hoping for.</p>

  <p>Time passed and things changed. My colleague made sure that team and customer were working closely together.</p>

  <p>Team learned how to get things done together and how to work with different stakeholders. He also kept expecting them to work with shared goals. They got the support they needed but nobody was doing their work - including responsibility over shared goals.</p>

  <p>Roughly one year later my colleague had a change to ask the same developer if his opinion is still the same. It wasn’t. He was actually little embarrassed about the view he had earlier. But my colleague understood the situation at that time. That person and the whole team was just acting like he they were used to. In the previous way of working it wasn’t the teams business to be responsible of plans and schedules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want find someone to blame, then go for the previous management culture. Team’s previous leaders had done the work of being responsible and doing the explaining for the team. But that is not what I want to highlight in this story.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My point is to remind that time and patience is needed when dealing with change and human beings. Trying and experiencing new things is not easy. Not to mention reflecting our own existing ideas based on what has changed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In most of the cases, repetition and different point of views is needed, too. One time is not enough for people to digest new things that might be totally opposite on what they have learned to be good and right.</p>

<p>Usually it has taken a very long time for things to be as they are now. It is not realistic to expect things to change totally in a week or two.  Although sometimes things can change fast, usually a hefty amount of patience, time and perseverance is needed during the journey towards new ways of working.</p>
