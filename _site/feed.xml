        <title>Beware of Ticketization!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My advice is to use as little ticket tools in software development as possible. They certainly have their benefits but overusing them usually reflects bad ways of working. Instead of fixing your ticket tool, aim to use it as little as possible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a term for a phenomenon how medicines have conquered almost all aspects of our lives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Medicalisation  is the process by which human conditions and problems come to be defined and treated as medical conditions, and thus become the subject of medical study, diagnosis, prevention, or treatment. (Source: Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not simply good or bad, but a definitely something complex and ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see a similar thing to happen in organizations. I call it ticketization (or issueization for all JIRA users out there). My quick definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ticketization is the process by which all problems come to be defined as a set of simple tickets, issues or tasks. All problems, goals and endeavours become the subject or creating, assigning and tracking tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tickets/issues/tasks/stories - whatever you choose to call them - are everywhere. If you don’t believe me, good luck on trying to get your IT support to do something without a ticket or issue on their system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s the same as with all things in life. When things go too far, bad things can happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“My issues and your issues”&lt;/em&gt;: Everyone is completing their own tickets only.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“That is someone else’s issue”&lt;/em&gt;: Tickets represent roles and division of work in unhealthy way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Requirements Manager created issues for the team”&lt;/em&gt;: Separation of thinking and doing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I assigned this issue for you”&lt;/em&gt;: Over using ticketing tool as management system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But things can go even more wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Doing what is told”&lt;/em&gt;: No adaptability over tickets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We must complete these issues”&lt;/em&gt;: No working on the whole. Focus on issue level. Completing issues becomes the goal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The more tickets the better”&lt;/em&gt;: Tickets as a metric of productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Let’s improve JIRA statuses and transitions”&lt;/em&gt;: Focusing on ticket process/flows instead of improving the actual product development flow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We all must use this ticket workflow”&lt;/em&gt;: Codified or predefined common workflows instead of team owning it’s process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Didn’t you see my comment in the ticket system?”&lt;/em&gt;: Discussing over tickets only.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“According to our ticket SLA metrics, your service is working just fine”&lt;/em&gt;: Managing the service over tickets (SLAs over created value).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what to do about this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not saying that you should stop using all ticket tools. That would be silly. Tools can be very helpful but they also shape how we work and think. They can also become barriers on improving the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My view is that when you need to rely very little on ticketing systems, you are probably doing fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You probably update what was discussed face to face to the ticketing system. Your communications are richer and faster.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are working with actual goals and have the needed adaptability, not just set of tickets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Team members are creating and assigning tickets by themselves, when needed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have simple ticketing workflow that represent elegant and reliable workflow in the actual work (e.g. Git workflow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have these sort of things in good condition your supporting tool works mostly ok. In other words, the better the work works for you, the less you get frustrated with your tools. So, don’t let your ticketing tool to become your master.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tip for your Agile Transformation: Let go</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One fundamental problem in traditional organisations is the separation of thinking and doing. That is the notion where the managers’ role is to think and plan how to do the work. And then, it is the workers’ role to execute according to plans handed to them. Organisations where this type of thinking prevails often end up doing their transformation efforts the same way. And that is one major reason why  transformations fail.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First the basics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All major modern/agile/lean/whatever organisation transformations are greatly about increasing the power and incluence of the people who are doing the grass-rool level work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But still many transformation efforts end-up like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“We are discussion this on our next management meeting”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“You are welcome to comment on the plans the management is making”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Our new CEO will come up with a plan”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, this equals missing the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of the first things to do, is to shift and redistribute the work of doing the thinking. It’s about bringing together all doing and thinking that happens in the organisation. And this should be visible in the structures and practices as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, it’s a big step. And yes, there are risks.  Something will definitely go wrong. People will not automatically know how to do things that were proviously taken care of by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes time. It is not easy. &lt;a href=&quot;http://villetormala.com/storytime-patience&quot;&gt;You need patience.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they will learn. And once they know more, the whole organisation knows more. And then you have better more and more healthy organisation. And definitily it will be more agile/lean/whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Organizational change is not about adopting a new trendy method. It’s about chaning the structures that keep the old ways of working in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no, inviting more people to work with the existing management process is not about redistributing power. People need to own and create their own their own work.  Then they have enough contextual knowledge and influence to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although remowing waste and optimizing workflows are central in lean, they are not the real essense of it. Instead, one of the most important success factors in lean is the &lt;em&gt;“ability to harness the intellect of each ordinary employees”&lt;/em&gt; to do and improve the work all the time. If you want to have an lean organisation, your fancy kanban board is just a collection of post-it notes without changes in the prevailing structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the managers who used to do all the thinking and planning? They have a now role. To teach, mentor, provide inspiration. Talk about the future. Have meaningfull discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as a first step, let go.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Storytime: Patience</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My colleague worked with a newly formed team couple of years ago. The story he shared reminded me of having realistic expectations and patience when dealing with unlearning of old ways of working.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Team made a plan how to deliver a set of features within one month to customer. Plan was made together and team was content with it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;After some time, my colleague who was coaching the team, noticed that team will not  be able to complete all the features they had planned and committed to. He decided to ask the team how they should communicate this to their customer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The answer was clear. “It’s not our problem. You are the boss, it’s your job to do the explaining”, said one of the member of the team. Obviously, this wasn’t the answer he was hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Time passed and things changed. My colleague made sure that team and customer were working closely together.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Team learned how to get things done together and how to work with different stakeholders. He also kept expecting them to work with shared goals. They got the support they needed but nobody was doing their work - including responsibility over shared goals.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Roughly one year later my colleague had a change to ask the same developer if his opinion is still the same. It wasn’t. He was actually little embarrassed about the view he had earlier. But my colleague understood the situation at that time. That person and the whole team was just acting like he they were used to. In the previous way of working it wasn’t the teams business to be responsible of plans and schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/clock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Treehouse&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want find someone to blame, then go for the previous management culture. Team’s previous leaders had done the work of being responsible and doing the explaining for the team. But that is not what I want to highlight in this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My point is to remind that time and patience is needed when dealing with change and human beings. Trying and experiencing new things is not easy. Not to mention reflecting our own existing ideas based on what has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most of the cases, repetition and different point of views is needed, too. One time is not enough for people to digest new things that might be totally opposite on what they have learned to be good and right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually it has taken a very long time for things to be as they are now. It is not realistic to expect things to change totally in a week or two.  Although sometimes things can change fast, usually a hefty amount of patience, time and perseverance is needed during the journey towards new ways of working.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Opposite ideas, part 2 - Project Thinking vs. Stable Teams Thinking</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This part 2 of my collection of oppposite ideas about central topics of Software Development. Like in the previous post, I originally made this for myself to clarify my own ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time the opposing ways of thinking are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Thinkin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stable Teams Thinking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, In real life things are not as black and white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you guessed right. I favor stable teams thinking. This table actually summarises the toolbox I use when starting to work with a struckling “team” (usually pseudo team).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##Staffing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Projects based organization and project resourcing.&lt;/strong&gt; Move people based on project needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization is build around stable and cross-functional teams.&lt;/strong&gt; Work is designed to fit stable teams. Manage the contents of the work that teams pull to their backlog.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;focus-of-improvement&quot;&gt;Focus of improvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Become better at resourcing people into projects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on building as good teams as possible and creating an environment for teams to flourish.&lt;/strong&gt; Become better at building communities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;optimize&quot;&gt;Optimize&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start as many projects as you can&lt;/strong&gt; The more the projects, the more the progress. Start new because there is work on hold.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit the number of projects.&lt;/strong&gt; The better the flow, the better the progress. Finish before starting new.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;management-focus&quot;&gt;Management focus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Available resources, needed resources.&lt;/strong&gt; Optimize projects (optimize locally).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value and flow (iterate on value, remove waste…)&lt;/strong&gt; Optimize products/services (optimize globally, end-to-end)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unit-of-production&quot;&gt;Unit of production&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A single person.&lt;/strong&gt; Specialised roles. Organizations are built around projects. Individuals as a unit of productions, individuals get the work done (and are rewared for it)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-functional stable team.&lt;/strong&gt; Organizations are built around stable teams. Teams as a unit of production, teams get the work done. When work is done, its impossible to say who did it and who gets the reward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;efficiency&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Efficiency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*
* &lt;strong&gt;”Measure how well resources are used to achieve ends”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“What we can do differently?“ “How to improve?”&lt;/strong&gt; Manage flow and waste. Iterate on value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;assignment&quot;&gt;Assignment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;”Executing a plan brings success” ”Complete this project as agreed”&lt;/strong&gt;
Work according to plan made by someone else. Local optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;”Plan how to deliver a solution to these customers”&lt;/strong&gt; 
“Here is the problem and goal. Find a best solution.” (Teams work on ”strategic level”). Global optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;method-for-improvement&quot;&gt;Method for improvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;”Doing the work is the work”&lt;/strong&gt; Improvement projects, improved processes, train people lecture style. Single loop learning: are we executing this right?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;”Doing the work and improving the work is the work.”&lt;/strong&gt; Improve team capability. Build-in improvement, front-line experiments and learning. Douple-loop learning: Are we doing the right things?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nature-of-the-work&quot;&gt;Nature of the work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work gets done when each of the needed special roles does their part according to plan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily work involves solving unique problems together.&lt;/strong&gt; The workers themselves have the best knowledge of the work. Leaning and development happens when people work on problems together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team goals, shared goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Opposite ideas, part 1 - Software Dedevelopment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my collection of oppposite ideas about central topics of Software Development. I originally made it for myself to clarify my own ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I’d have to name the two opposing ideas, they would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traditional Ideas&lt;/strong&gt; (Manufacturing mindset, Tayloristic thinking, SW Factory…)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative Ideas&lt;/strong&gt; (Agile, Lean, DevOps, Systems Thinking, Complexity Theory…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know. In real life things are not as black and white as this form of presenation indicates. Although I am huge advocate of the alternative ideas, the idea is not to point right and wrong answers but to highlight differences in thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;definition-of-done&quot;&gt;Definition of Done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Project (work) ends in production deployment”&lt;/strong&gt; Production deployment is done at the end of the project. Big lauch at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Project (work) starts from the first production deployment”&lt;/strong&gt; First production deployment is done within days (or even hours) from the kick-off. Gradually building full-time production usage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;planning&quot;&gt;Planning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Do it right the first time”&lt;/strong&gt; Big upfront design. Deliver in one big batch (or in several big batches).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Add needed pieces only when needed.”&lt;/strong&gt; Deliver in small pieces incremantally, in streams.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;process&quot;&gt;Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*“One time process with separate functional phases and roles”&lt;/em&gt; Separation of work and working units. Tayloristic desing of work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Iterate over the process many times fast as a cross-functional team”&lt;/strong&gt; Whole team approach. Cross-functional teams.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;decision-making&quot;&gt;Decision making&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Analyse and gather all needed information beforehand.”&lt;/strong&gt; Get needed knowledge before starting the actual development work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Software development is a knowledge creation process.”&lt;/strong&gt; Decide as late as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;architecture--design&quot;&gt;Architecture &amp;amp; Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Know all (most) technical details in the beginning.”&lt;/strong&gt; Create detailed design and architecture upfront.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Focus on vision and goals.”&lt;/strong&gt; Let details emerge during the process.”Plan on adequate level (sometimes quite a lot, find the boundaries). Iterate and evolve design and architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;focus-on-plans&quot;&gt;Focus on plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Focus on following the plan and delivering according to plan”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Focus on delivering outcomes and value”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;definition-of-success&quot;&gt;Definition of Success&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Keeping project in time/budget/schedule”&lt;/strong&gt; Fixed schedule, budget, scope&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Measured added customer value”&lt;/strong&gt; Flexibility over scope. Digg into value of each feature. Optimizing value requires being flexible over scope.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-go-fast&quot;&gt;How to go fast&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Work harder and keep everyone busy”&lt;/strong&gt; Manage efficiency and utilization. Optimize time and resources to get faster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Focus on flow efficiency, keep the work flowing”&lt;/strong&gt; Manage and optimize product development flow to get faster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;efficiency-speed-cost&quot;&gt;Efficiency, speed, cost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We need to code faster”&lt;/strong&gt; Cost is in the length of an activity. Optimize each separate activity to get faster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We need to work smarter”&lt;/strong&gt; Cost is in the inefficient flow. Optimize the flow and remove waste to get faster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quality&quot;&gt;Quality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Inspect quality when done”&lt;/strong&gt; Use external measures to inspect quality. Fix possible problems at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Build quality in”&lt;/strong&gt; Prevent defects from happening. Add quality within the work. Stop the line when process is broken.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-improvement&quot;&gt;Learning, improvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Improve through company wide standardization and best practices.”&lt;/strong&gt; Separate improvement projects. Work is driven by processes and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Improve  through experimentation within the work.”&lt;/strong&gt; Learning and improving build in to the work. Follow principles agreed within the team.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;process-ownership&quot;&gt;Process Ownership&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Company owns the process. Use audits and standards.”&lt;/strong&gt; Single loop learning: “Are we doing this right”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Autonomy and ownership of the work is within the team.”&lt;/strong&gt; Team owns and improves its working process. Double loop learning: Why are we doing this?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-improvement-1&quot;&gt;Learning, improvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Analyse project success in the end or in the phase-gates.”&lt;/strong&gt; Late learning. Lessons-learned studies / post-mortems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Aim for fast feedback cycle.”&lt;/strong&gt; Get feedback after every iteration / all the time (hourly, daily, weekly)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;decision-making-1&quot;&gt;Decision making&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centralized decision making outside the team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Those who do the actual work make decisions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;value-benefits&quot;&gt;Value, benefits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Analyse value”&lt;/strong&gt; Analyse value based on planning phase studies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Measure value”&lt;/strong&gt; Analyse and measure value early based on actual data from production use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;risk-management&quot;&gt;Risk management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Manage deliverable and process quality”&lt;/strong&gt; Milestone plans and phase-gates, proceed when certain criteria is met. Fail at the end (usually), impact and cost is high.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Reduce risk everyday”&lt;/strong&gt; Build high risk and high value items first. Mitigate risks by doing the risky work right away. Fail fast, impact and cost of failure is low.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Opposite ideas, part 1 - Software Dedevelopment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my collection of oppposite ideas about central topics of Software Development. I originally made it for myself to clarify my own ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I’d have to name the two opposing ideas, they would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traditional Ideas&lt;/strong&gt; (Manufacturing mindset, Tayloristic thinking, SW Factory…)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative Ideas&lt;/strong&gt; (Agile, Lean, DevOps, Systems Thinking, Complexity Theory…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know. In real life things are not as black and white as this form of presenation indicates. Although I am huge advocate of the alternative ideas, the idea is not to point right and wrong answers but to highlight differences in thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;definition-of-done&quot;&gt;Definition of Done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Project (work) ends in production deployment”&lt;/strong&gt; Production deployment is done at the end of the project. Big lauch at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Project (work) starts from the first production deployment”&lt;/strong&gt; First production deployment is done within days (or even hours) from the kick-off. Gradually building full-time production usage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;planning&quot;&gt;Planning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Do it right the first time”&lt;/strong&gt; Big upfront design. Deliver in one big batch (or in several big batches).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Add needed pieces only when needed.”&lt;/strong&gt; Deliver in small pieces incremantally, in streams.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;process&quot;&gt;Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*“One time process with separate functional phases and roles”&lt;/em&gt; Separation of work and working units. Tayloristic desing of work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Iterate over the process many times fast as a cross-functional team”&lt;/strong&gt; Whole team approach. Cross-functional teams.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;decision-making&quot;&gt;Decision making&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Analyse and gather all needed information beforehand.”&lt;/strong&gt; Get needed knowledge before starting the actual development work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Software development is a knowledge creation process.”&lt;/strong&gt; Decide as late as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;architecture--design&quot;&gt;Architecture &amp;amp; Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Know all (most) technical details in the beginning.”&lt;/strong&gt; Create detailed design and architecture upfront.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Focus on vision and goals.”&lt;/strong&gt; Let details emerge during the process.”Plan on adequate level (sometimes quite a lot, find the boundaries). Iterate and evolve design and architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;focus-on-plans&quot;&gt;Focus on plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Focus on following the plan and delivering according to plan”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Focus on delivering outcomes and value”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;definition-of-success&quot;&gt;Definition of Success&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Keeping project in time/budget/schedule”&lt;/strong&gt; Fixed schedule, budget, scope&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Measured added customer value”&lt;/strong&gt; Flexibility over scope. Digg into value of each feature. Optimizing value requires being flexible over scope.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-go-fast&quot;&gt;How to go fast&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Work harder and keep everyone busy”&lt;/strong&gt; Manage efficiency and utilization. Optimize time and resources to get faster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Focus on flow efficiency, keep the work flowing”&lt;/strong&gt; Manage and optimize product development flow to get faster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;efficiency-speed-cost&quot;&gt;Efficiency, speed, cost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We need to code faster”&lt;/strong&gt; Cost is in the length of an activity. Optimize each separate activity to get faster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We need to work smarter”&lt;/strong&gt; Cost is in the inefficient flow. Optimize the flow and remove waste to get faster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quality&quot;&gt;Quality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Inspect quality when done”&lt;/strong&gt; Use external measures to inspect quality. Fix possible problems at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Build quality in”&lt;/strong&gt; Prevent defects from happening. Add quality within the work. Stop the line when process is broken.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-improvement&quot;&gt;Learning, improvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Improve through company wide standardization and best practices.”&lt;/strong&gt; Separate improvement projects. Work is driven by processes and practices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Company owns the process. Use audits and standards.”&lt;/strong&gt; Single loop learning: “Are we doing this right”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

        <title>It's Your Treehouse</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating a team space is more than suitable seating arrangement. As a leader your job is not to tweak the office space but to arrange prober conditions for the team to build their own treehouse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team needs a place where to work together. So, with that basic requirement, what are you about to build?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you arrange “an office space” for the team? Plan and fix seating arrangements? Perhaps add a coffee maker and a plant to put finishing touches to it. This is all fine, but in my opinion not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I propose another kind of mindset: Find a place where team can build their own “team space”. To distinguish it from an “office space”, I would call it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Team Lounge&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Living room&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hideout&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lair&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refuge&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Garage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even a treehouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/treehouse.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Treehouse&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure you can come up with a better name. Naming is important because words convey meaning. All the examples above embody different thinking and ideas than “office space”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;its-your-treehouse&quot;&gt;It’s Your Treehouse&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to have a dedicated place where your team feels like home. Something they build and belongs to them. It’s their sofa, their coffee maker, their rituals, their rules. And most probably, their mess, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your treehouse, you feel safe to speak out, present your ideas, wear an ugly T-shirt etc. Something that you probably wouldn’t do in a large open space with 50 other (strange) people. Openness and transparency is a good target. But too much of it can prevent collaboration, experiments and healthy amount of risk taking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams and individuals need some level of privacy. Maybe add phone booths in the treehouse where people can go when they need personal privacy and silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the idea is not to hide yourself from the rest of the world. You want to have the opposite. It’s better to have good quality meetups rather than being exposed to clutter that doesn’t concern you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your treehouse is not only a place where you do your work.  A place where you &lt;em&gt;invite others&lt;/em&gt;. And make it &lt;em&gt;easy for others to make a visit.&lt;/em&gt; Kind of like your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;nomeetings&quot;&gt;#nomeetings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a team, going into a meeting somewhere else can imply broken power structures (decision making), wasted time, slow cadence (waiting for meetings) and poor productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding a time slot that suits all and booking a meeting room is slow and unproductive – waste. Inviting people to have mini retrospective should be matter of minutes, not days (or even weeks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Having a separate meeting scheduled long in the future to plan, review, meet, make decisions, get more info, discuss etc. can be considered an anti-pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the treehouse, there is a plenty of space in the walls (whiteboards) to draw. TV-screen or two. A sofa. Webcam. Etc. Your treehouse is the 24/7 ~meeting~ conversation room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You want to replace as many meetings you can with good quality conversations. Team has a good chance of success when do the work and all the time talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You already know the rationale behind all this. When you really want to have results, individuals and interactions matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluent information flows are essential. In team’s shared audible and visible space, everyone usually knows what is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All forms of communication are not equal. Rich forms of communication make all the difference. Try having a Skype meeting with and without video. Actually seeing the people you talk with changes the experience and how you interpret the message. We are human after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brilliant working environment for the team is a priority. The goal is to have good quality information flow and rich form of communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When the enabling conditions are the, you can expect the quality of the conversations to get better. This is a basic requirement for the team to learn and start developing their own ways of working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>People do the minimum because you ask them to</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Organizations and managers always hope more of their people than they know how to ask for. They want everyone to be more motivated, more self-organized and more accountable. Instead of interfering directly with employees, organization’s need to examine their mental models and what kind of behavior prevailing structures promote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite question to development teams and their members is: &lt;em&gt;“What is your goal? What is your project aiming for?”&lt;/em&gt; Answer is often along these lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Working for customer”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Working for project”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Working for product foobar”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly something is missing. People are working for something but they just can’t explain it in compelling way or in enough detail. To me that is a problem. But the problem is not in the people who provide such answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In “The New New Product Development Game” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (the HBR Article where Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland got their ideas for Scrum) Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka describe the idea of self-organizing teams:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A project team takes on a self-organizing character as it is driven to a state of “zero information”—where prior knowledge does not apply. Ambiguity and fluctuation abound in this state. Left to stew, the process begins to create its own dynamic order. The project team begins to operate like a start-up company—it takes initiatives and risks, and develops an independent agenda. At some point, the team begins to create its own concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How often do you see this happen in practice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many organizations promote self-organization. But many times, most of the thinking and planning has been already done before work is handed out to development teams. Too often teams are forced to use company processes and tools that don’t help them. And before the team even gets started one team members is moved to another project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separation of thinking and doing is still prevailing in the organizations’ structures and ways of working. Real power still lies outside of the teams doing the actual work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these organizations, the primary question is not how to make teams more motivated, how to get people take more responsibility or how to get team members to work together. These are the end results of organizations structures, roles, rules etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-written tasks and vague themes where some else has done all the thinking beforehand equals to asking very little. People do little because organizations ask them to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals and teams have more reason to feel motivated, accountable and to collaborate when they are handed a clear and compelling business problem.  Teams need something more strategic that they genuinely own and can self-organize around to.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Getting rid of management meetings</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of our recent improvement ideas is to reduce number of management meetings. Actually, we are not having that many of them, but we still want to have less. By management meetings I mean the events where, say, project manager and customer representative go to meeting room to discuss status and do some planning. Meeting minutes are often shared with rest of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a habit. Something we have used to. We justify their existence by saying that we save the precious time of developers doing the actual work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lately I have been more and more starting to consider these meetings as an anti-pattern. My concern is the discrepancy on what we actually do and how we would like things to be. We want teams to take control and make decisions. From that perspective, having these type of meetings is incompatible with our cultural goals. They clearly demonstrate that the real power and influence is elsewhere and behind closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, no need to overreact. We are not banning any meetings. We just want to have less magemenent by memo and include the whole team in all discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s have one example. Previously I used to collect customer &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; dev team feedback using a questionnaire. Feedback was then presented in the steering group meetings. But last time we sat down with the whole team and customer and had a feedback session face-to-face. Needless to say which of these methods was more productive. And yes, there is still a summary of the feedback in the steering group meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To me this management meeting anti-pattern has been a blind spot. Perhaps mostly because it’s build into certain roles and role expectations. I like to think myself as a quite advanced what comes to teaming and team dynamics. Yet we still have had this kind of structural anti pattern around. I am sure there are also other similar patterns and habits that are left unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a healthy reminder to always question all the things we do. And also to analyze whether current ways of working support the ideas and culture we want to aim for.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sit down and think what features to remove</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Success of a software product is hugely dependent on ability to change and improve it during its lifetime. You want to minimize the time, effort and cost of changes starting from the first early release. This is obvious to everyone. But there are other aspects and not all of them are equally obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a huge life-cycle cost and burden in software complexity. Simple, clean design and good engineering practices help a lot. But there is one central point where things get serious: &lt;strong&gt;The more software you add the more complexity you get.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to great engineering practices you need &lt;em&gt;a strict culture of adding only the absolutely necessary features and evaluate their value all the time&lt;/em&gt;. Like many of the things in software development this is nothing new. Just look at the mindset of the early Unix developers &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everything was small… and my heart sinks for Linux when I see the size of it. […] The manual page, which really used to be a manual page, is now a small volume, with a thousand options… &lt;strong&gt;We used to sit around in the Unix Room saying, ‘What can we throw out?&lt;/strong&gt; Why is there this option?’ It’s often because there is some deficiency in the basic design — you didn’t really hit the right design point. Instead of adding an option, think about what was forcing you to add that option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you tried sitting down with your team (or your customer) to think what features to throw out? If you haven’t, do it right away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why you don’t see this happening often is caused by a conflic between what we would like to do and what we do instead. All professionals would like to create simple and elegant solutions. But as an industry we follow a very different mindset than the person quoted above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our prevailing contracting models often dictate big upfront design with late big batch deliveries.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long delivery cycles make iterating on small valuable items impossible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feature creep is incorporated deeply in “list all the requirements and get them right in the first place”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And with detailed plans made before the first phase-gate, all you need to do is to manage 100% efficiency and follow the plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a problem deep in the mindset and habits of our industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you, a software development professional, want to do better and optimize long-term benefits to keep productivity high and costs low. That includes explaining your customer that &lt;strong&gt;“we are going to deliver as little code and features as possible and that is for your benefit”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
